## Desctription
The program generates a new figure at the begining and after every time your figure hits an obstacle.

It has 5 different types of figures such as:
- T-figure
- S-figure
- L-figure
- Stick
- Sguare  

Every figure can be rotated or moved in different directions.  
Figures are falling down, so your time is limited. The mission is to hold out as long as possible!

When you fill any row with figures, so that it has no free space left, the row is deleted.  
But if the same situation occurs in any column, unfortunately, you will see "Game Over" on the console.  

This is a console game, to start it you just need to run the program.
## How to play
- <b>Move</b> your figure using arrows on your keyboard
- <b>Rotate</b> it by pressing the spacebar (figures may have different number of rotation states)
