A simple console Tetris game implemented in C#.

## Description

The program generates a new figure at the start, and after each time your figure hits an obstacle. 

The game includes 5 different types of figures:
- **T-Figure**
- **S-Figure**
- **L-Figure**
- **Stick**
- **Square**

### Game Features:
- Each figure can be rotated and moved in different directions.
- Figures fall down over time, adding a challenge to make quick decisions.
- The objective is to hold out as long as possible!
- If any row is completely filled with figures (no gaps), the row is cleared.
- If a column is filled completely, the game ends and youâ€™ll see "Game Over" on the console.

### How to Start:
This is a console game. To start playing, simply run the program.

## How to Play

- **Move the figure**: Use the arrow keys to move your figure left or right.
- **Rotate the figure**: Press the spacebar to rotate the figure. (Each figure has different rotation states.)
